Google Apps is a software-as-a-service platform (SAAS) that provides email, calendar, documents and other services. This
connector uses the Google Apps provisioning APIs to create, add, delete and modify user accounts and email aliases.

Please note that only the Premium (paid) or Educational versions of Google Apps provide access to the provisioning APIs. <em>This connector will not work on free Google Apps domains.</em>
